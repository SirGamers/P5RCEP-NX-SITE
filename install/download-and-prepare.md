### Set up P5R Mods folder.&#x20;

We will use a dedicated directory for our P5R modding tools. If you ever need to create a file backup, take a screenshot, or write down a note, save it in this folder to stay organized.

<details>

<summary>Important Terms</summary>

**P5R Mods** folder: A unified folder for your P5R modding setup.

There are three folders in the **P5R Mods** folder:

* **Backups**: Use this folder to store any important files or folders you want to save.
* **Notes:** Use this folder to store any information you think is worth keeping.
* **Setup:** This folder contains the All-in-One Prerequisite Installer that downloads and installs the runtimes your modding tools need.

</details>

### Prepare P5R Mods Folder

* Unzip your downloaded P5RCEP NX archive.
* Open the unzipped archive and locate the **P5R Mods** folder inside.

## Set Up Aemulus Folder

****[**Aemulus Package Manager**](https://aemulus.cep.one/) is a program that downloads, organizes, and builds mods for many different Persona games. It's included with P5RCEP NX!

Since you might want to use Aemulus for multiple Persona games, not just P5R, we'll place it alongside the **P5R Mods** folder instead of inside it.

<details>

<summary>Important Terms</summary>
