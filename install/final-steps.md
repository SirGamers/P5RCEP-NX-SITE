# Final Steps

You're almost done! Take the file from your folder and connect your Switch using FTP or plug in your SD card into your computer and then put the file into `sdmc:/atmosphere/contents/01005CA01580E000/romfs/`

{% hint style="info" %}
If any of these folders do not exist, then create the folders.
{% endhint %}

Then launch the game and see if any of the mods work.

If they don't then ask in the p5-user-help in the [Persona Modding discord server](https://discord.gg/naoto).
